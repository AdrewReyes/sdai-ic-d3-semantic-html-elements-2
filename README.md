# Semantic HTML Elements Lab 2 - Try it Together

## Description 📄
In this Try It Together activity, you'll be code builders! Now that you have a refactored semantic HTML codebase, why not go a little further by adding some semantic styling and a few more sections. 

---

## Developer Objectives 📋

**Refactor generic elements:** Replacing generic elements with semantic ones.
**Using generative AI:** Use generative AI to refactor a codebase ethically and professionally.
**Embrace semantic elements:** Reading the response from generative AI on the reason for the use of semantic elements.

---

## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Choose which generative AI you would like to use. 
2. [ ] Write a prompt using your prompt engineering skills that will ask the AI to refactor the HTML into semantic HTML for you. 
3. [ ] Copy the HTML document and paste it in the generative AI after your prompt.
4. [ ] Watch the AI work.
5. [ ] Note the changes that AI made to your document. 
   1. What is different? 
   2. What stayed the same?
   3. Did the AI give any explanations?
6. [ ] Copy and paste the refactored code to your codespace and save it. You will use it in the next activity.

🎊 **Fantastic work! You just used AI to refactor HTML to Semantic HTML! 💃🏻🕺🏾** 🎊
