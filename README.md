# Semantic HTML Elements Lab 2 - Try it Together

## Description 📄
In this Try It Together activity, we are going to take Chris Doe's webpage a step further by applying semantic HTML. This means using specific tags that clearly describe the content, making the page not only more user-friendly but also easier for search engines to understand. You'll focus on making Chris's name stand out, adding details to his "About Me" section, highlighting his key skills with semantic tags, and creating a more organized structure with nested sections. Finally, you'll put the finishing touches on his portfolio by creating a "Recent Projects" section with a list showcasing his work.

## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [x] Navigate to the `index.html` file. 
2. [x] On line 23, make the copy `I'm Chris Doe!` bold wrapping the copy in the correct semantic HTML tag. Remember how the screen reader will read the tag.
3. [x] After the `I'm Chris Doe` copy, paste the following copy to make the paragraph tag more robust: `Throughout my career, I've worn multiple hats in the web development industry. As a Front-End Developer, I meticulously crafted pixel-perfect user interfaces for various clients. During my tenure as a UX Designer, I focused on creating intuitive and delightful user experiences. As a Full-Stack Engineer I built robust web applications from the ground up. Additionally, I've freelanced on diverse projects, ranging from e-commerce sites to personal blogs. My journey also includes a stint as a Production Assistant at Webflix Studios, where I contributed to video production and multimedia content creation.`
4. [x] Next, emphasize the following five word pairs using semantic HTML in the copy above:
   1. [x] Front-End Developer
   2. [x] UX Designer
   3. [x] Full-Stack Engineer
   4. [x] Production Assistant
   5. [x] Webflix Studios
5. [x] Next ,inside the `<main>` container with 1 `<section>` element, put one more `<section>` under the first `<section>`.
6. [x] Inside the second `<section>` element, put a subheader element with the copy: `Recent Projects`.
7. [x] Under that, put a paragraph element with the copy: `Check out some of my recent work:`
8. [x] Now, copy and paste the unordered list in the `About me` section under the last paragraph tag and refactor the copy in the elements as follows:
   1. [x] Change the first list tag from `X` to `Portfolio Website`.
   2. [x] Change the second list tag from `LinkedIn` to  `E-commerce Site`.
   3. [x] Change the third list tag from `GitHub` to `Blog Platform`.
